## ✅ Day 1 – Python Basics + I/O

**Topics**: Variables, Data Types, `input()`, `print()`, Type Casting

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Accept user name and age → print a greeting.
- [ ] Swap two numbers (with and without using a third variable).
- [ ] Convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
- [ ] Take a string input → reverse it using slicing.

---

## ✅ Day 2 – Conditionals + Loops

**Topics**: `if`, `elif`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Odd/Even checker
- [ ] Simple calculator with `+ - * / %` using if-else
- [ ] Prime number checker up to N
- [ ] Multiplication table using a loop
- [ ] Number guessing game (1–10, retry until guessed)

---

## ✅ Day 3 – Functions & Lambda

**Topics**: `def`, return, `*args`, `**kwargs`, lambda, scope

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Function to check if a number is palindrome
- [ ] Function to count vowels in a string
- [ ] Write a lambda to double a list using `map()`
- [ ] Function that takes any number of inputs and returns their average

---

## ✅ Day 4 – Lists, Tuples, Sets

**Topics**: CRUD operations on lists, tuples, sets, slicing

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add/remove elements in a list
- [ ] Remove duplicates from a list using set
- [ ] Find union and intersection of two sets
- [ ] Create a list of squares of even numbers from 1–20 using list comprehension
- [ ] Tuple unpacking task

---

## ✅ Day 5 – Dictionaries + File I/O

**Topics**: Key-value pairs, loop over dict, reading/writing files

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Dictionary of students and marks → print who passed (marks > 40)
- [ ] Word counter: Read a `.txt` file and count word frequency
- [ ] Write user input to a file and read it back
- [ ] Merge two dictionaries

---

## ✅ Day 6 – OOP + Error Handling

**Topics**: Classes, `__init__`, methods, inheritance, `try/except`

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create a `BankAccount` class → deposit, withdraw, show balance
- [ ] Inherit `Employee` into `Manager` → add `team_size`
- [ ] Raise and handle a custom exception for invalid balance
- [ ] Use `try/except/finally` for safe file reading

---

## ✅ Day 7 – Modules + Final Mini Project

**Topics**: Custom modules, built-ins, `venv`, pip

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create a module `math_utils.py` with `add`, `multiply`, `factorial` functions
- [ ] Use `datetime`, `random`, `os` in meaningful ways
- [ ] Create a virtual environment and install `requests`
- [ ] Mini Project (Choose One):
  - 🗂️ **To-Do App (CLI)** – Add, mark as done, delete tasks (store in a file)
  - 📝 **Student Record Manager** – Add/view/edit/delete student info stored in a dictionary/file
